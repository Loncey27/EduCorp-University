            <p>
              The PhD in Data-Driven Decision Sciences is designed for scholars
              interested in advancing the use of data for strategic,
              evidence-based decision-making. Research areas include
              optimization models, decision theory, operations research,
              computational economics, and behavioral analytics. Candidates
              develop expertise in using data to inform policies, investment
              strategies, and resource allocation in complex environments.
            </p>

            <p>
              The PhD in Computational Intelligence focuses on biologically
              inspired computation, hybrid AI models, and intelligent
              optimization algorithms. Students conduct advanced research in
              evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, fuzzy systems, and
              neural computation. The program supports both theoretical
              innovation and real-world application in fields such as robotics,
              simulation, and adaptive control systems.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Doctoral candidates benefit from interdisciplinary collaboration
              with departments in biology, engineering, and cognitive science,
              enabling them to build complex adaptive systems. Graduates often
              contribute to next-generation technologies and publish in leading
              AI and systems journals.
