              real-world systems into digital models, enabling predictions,
              testing, and optimization through simulation. The curriculum
              includes applied mathematics, physics-based modeling, algorithm
              design, and software development.

              Graduates are equipped to work in areas such as systems biology,
              environmental forecasting, engineering design, and urban planning.
              They gain experience using simulation tools like MATLAB and
              Simulink, as well as general-purpose programming languages, to
              create models that support innovation and decision-making in
              complex environments.

              The Bachelor of Applied Statistics with Data Science focuses on
              statistical theory and practical data applications. Students are
              trained in probability, regression analysis, hypothesis testing,
              and survey methodology, along with modern data science tools such
              as Python, R, and SQL. The goal is to produce professionals
              capable of extracting knowledge from data and solving real-world
              problems using statistical reasoning.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In addition to classroom instruction, students undertake fieldwork
              and projects involving demographic studies, risk modeling, and
              public health data. This degree opens doors to careers in
              government statistics offices, market research, healthcare
              analytics, and global development organizations where quantitative
